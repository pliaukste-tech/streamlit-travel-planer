Please write a simple chatbot using Streamlit and Google AI Studio which helps me to plan traveling.

The chatbot should ask for 4 inputs:

Country: I.E. Italy.
Activities that you like: I.E. Hiking, Cooking.
Days to spend in Country: I.E. 3
Report weight: Long or short.

I want to pass Google AI Studio api-key in text-box.

Upon entering the parameters, the program should print the itenery of the trip in selected Country.

Give me instructions how to run the chatbot.
I am not programmer.
